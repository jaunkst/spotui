# spotui

A Spotify terminal user interface (TUI) client written in Rust.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Spotify Premium is required to use this application.**

## About

spotui is a fork of the original [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) project by Alexander Keliris (Rigellute) and its contributors. The original project stopped compiling with newer Rust versions, so spotui was created to:

- Update Rust dependencies and ensure compatibility with modern toolchains
- Add missing features for a better user experience
- Fix existing bugs and improve stability

We are grateful to all the developers who contributed to spotify-tui - this project wouldn't exist without their excellent foundation.

## Features

- Control playback (play/pause, next/previous, seek)
- Browse playlists, albums, artists, and tracks
- Search for music
- Manage devices
- View audio analysis visualizations
- Like/unlike tracks
- Follow/unfollow artists and playlists
- And much more!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Spotify Premium account (required for playback control)
- For a complete terminal-only experience without the official Spotify client, consider using [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

### From Source

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/yourusername/spotui
```

#### Note on Linux

For compilation on Linux, the development packages for `libssl` are required. See [OpenSSL installation instructions](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic). The compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.

### Package Managers

Package manager support coming soon.

## Connecting to Spotify's API

spotui needs to connect to Spotify's API to function. Instructions will be shown when you first run the app, but here they are for reference:

1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Click `Create an app`
   - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
3. Click `Edit Settings`
4. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
5. Scroll down and click `Save`
6. Run `spotui`
7. Enter your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
8. Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port
9. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions
10. After accepting, you'll be redirected to localhost. The URL will be parsed automatically and you're ready to go!

## Usage

The binary is named `spotui`.

Running `spotui` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.

### Using with spotifyd

[spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd) is a lightweight Spotify daemon that allows you to use spotui without having the official Spotify client running.

1. Install and start spotifyd following their documentation
2. Start spotui
3. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu - spotifyd should appear as an available device
